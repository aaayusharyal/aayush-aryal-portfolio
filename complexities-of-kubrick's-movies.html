    <h2><strong>Complexities of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=stanley+kubrick&ie=UTF-8">Stanley Kubrick's</a> films</strong> </h2>
    <img src="kubri.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Stanley Kubrick was an American filmmaker and photographer. A major figure of the post-war film industry, Kubrick is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential filmmakers in the history of cinema.
   It feels like Kubrick was never interested in just enjoying his audience,  his movies contain lot of unanswered questions, meanings which are not obvious at first. For some people, including me, his movies feel frustrating and confusing at certain time. </p>
   <ul>
    <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Strangelove">Dr.Strange Love (1964)</a></li>
    <p>This is one of the strangest comedies ever made. A deranged general starts a nuclear strike on the Soviet Union, and the rest of the film is about politicians and generals scrambling to stop the end of the world. The characters are ridiculous, from the calm President trying to talk down the Soviets to Dr. Strangelove, a bizarre ex-Nazi scientist with a mechanical arm that won’t behave.

The tricky part for viewers is that Kubrick is asking us to laugh at a situation that is horrifying. The world is about to be destroyed, yet the scenes are funny and absurd. This mix of comedy and dread makes some people unsure how to feel.</p>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Clockwork_Orange_(film)">The Clockwork Orange (1971)</a></li>
<p>This is the story of Alex, a violent young man who robs, assaults, and even kills for fun. Eventually, he is caught and forced into a government experiment that removes his ability to commit violence. He becomes “good,” but not by choice.

The complexity here is psychological. We start by hating Alex, but as the story continues, we start to pity him. Kubrick makes us question whether a person who cannot choose evil can truly be good. Many viewers are disturbed by how the movie makes them feel sympathy for such a terrible person.

That’s the genius of it, Kubrick forces us to think about free will.</p>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shining_(film)">The Shining (1980)</a></li>
<p>Jack Torrance takes a job as the winter caretaker of the isolated Overlook Hotel. He brings his wife Wendy and son Danny, who has a psychic ability called “the shining.” Over the winter, Jack slowly loses his mind under the hotel’s influence and becomes a danger to his family.

What confuses people is how strange the hotel feels. Hallways don’t match, mirrors show unsettling images, and there are ghosts that may or may not be real. The film never fully explains what is happening, was Jack possessed, or was he always violent?

That mystery is what makes the movie so scary. Kubrick doesn’t just want to scare us, he wants us to feel trapped in the hotel with Jack, losing our grip on what is real. Also the ending of the movie is quite weird.</p>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Metal_Jacket">Full Metal Jacket (1987)</a></li>
<p>This film is divided into two parts. The first half shows brutal military training under Sergeant Hartman, who verbally abuses the recruits until one of them, Private Pyle, snaps and kills him before taking his own life. The second half follows Joker, one of the recruits, as he serves as a war correspondent in Vietnam.

Viewers sometimes struggle with this split structure because it feels like two different movies. But that is deliberate, Kubrick is showing us how the dehumanizing training in the first half prepares these men for the moral chaos of war in the second.

The film is complex because it refuses to glorify war. Instead, it shows how young men are turned into killers, and how they cope (or fail to cope) with what they become.</p>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyes_Wide_Shut">Eyes Wide Shut (1999)</a></li>
<p>Dr. Bill Harford’s jealousy over his wife’s confession of a fantasy sends him into a strange night-long journey through New York City. He meets prostitutes, is warned about secret societies, and sneaks into a masked ritual where he witnesses something that feels dangerous and forbidden.

Many viewers find this film slow and confusing because it feels like a dream. Conversations seem off, events feel too perfect or too eerie, and by the end, we still don’t know how powerful this secret group really is.

Kubrick’s final film is about temptation, jealousy, and how fragile relationships can be. It leaves you with questions, not answers, which is why people still debate it to this day.</p>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey">2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)</a></li>
<p></p>This is the movie that frustrates casual viewers the most. It starts with prehistoric apes discovering a mysterious black monolith, then jumps millions of years ahead to a space mission with a computer named HAL 9000. HAL malfunctions, kills most of the crew, and is shut down by the surviving astronaut, Dave Bowman. The final act is a strange, wordless journey through space and time, ending with Dave becoming a “star child” floating above Earth.

The complexity here comes from Kubrick’s refusal to explain anything. There are long stretches with no dialogue. The meaning of the monolith, HAL’s motives, and the ending are never spelled out. Many first-time viewers call it boring or confusing.

But if you stay with it, the film becomes a spiritual experience. Kubrick is asking us to think about evolution, human destiny, and our place in the universe. It is not a film you just watch, it is a film you feel.

   <center><h2>The iconic <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/50/b2/cd/50b2cd60337d834a82fa862ca85dcde5.jpg">Kubrick Stare</a></h2></center>
   <img src="download (1).jpg" alt="">
   <p>The Kubrick stare is a technique used to portray insane or unstable characters in film. In a Kubrick stare, an actor looks out from under the brow line and tilts their head towards the camera. Deemed "one of cinema's most recognizable shots" by film critic Robbie Collin, the technique is named after Stanley Kubrick, who often used it, but it has also been used by other directors before and since. The term was coined by cinematographer Douglas Milsome to describe one of Alex's facial expressions in the Kubrick film A Clockwork Orange (1971).</p>
   <p>Amy Nolan, an associate professor of English at Wartburg College, wrote that the stare often acts as silent communication between characters, especially when the one staring has crossed "from sanity to insanity with an already-fragile ego".

Researcher Matthew Melia notes that an actor performing the stare will give the impression that they are looking past the fourth wall and directly at the audience. He describes the technique as "invasive" and "troubling". Slate remarks that the facial expression is perhaps unrivalled in evoking fear in cinema. </p>
