       I believe rationality is the foundation of human progress. While emotions shape our individuality, it is reason that guides us beyond instinct and chance. To live rationally is to question, to test, and to refine — a discipline that separates blind acceptance from deliberate choice. For me, rationality is not about suppressing feelings, but about channeling them into decisions that withstand logic and scrutiny.

        Unlike other beings, humans possess the unique ability to reflect on their own existence and reshape the environment according to thought. This superiority is not a privilege to exploit but a responsibility to act wisely. A bird may fly by instinct, but humans fly by engineering. Our dominance is not defined by brute force but by our capacity to imagine, design, and build realities that nature itself never offered us.

        The world remembers men like Linus Torvalds not because they followed trends but because they built tools that transformed how billions interact with technology. Such individuals embody the spirit of creation over consumption. They remind us that true greatness emerges from solving problems at their root, with elegance, persistence, and often an obsession with improvement.

        Technology is, at its core, problem-solving in motion. Every piece of software, every algorithm, every innovation exists to reduce friction in life and expand what is possible. To approach technology philosophically is to see it as an extension of human reason — a toolset to battle inefficiency, to automate repetition, and to empower creativity. For me, writing code is not just programming; it is sculpting solutions with logic as my chisel.

        There is no shortcut to mastery. The grind is not glamorous, nor is it always enjoyable, but it forges resilience where talent alone fails. Hours spent debugging, learning, failing, and trying again are not wasted; they are investments in character. Every keypress, every correction, every attempt stacks upon the last until they form a wall of competence that cannot be shaken. If there is one truth I trust, it is that persistence turns vision into reality.
